                The main responsibility I had was to work with a mobile first perspective to solve identified user
                problems trough design. This included creating wireframes, prototypes and to conduct usability
                testings while communicating with stakeholders and developers.

                X5 Music works with packaging and distributing music for different outlets, i.e iTunes and
                Spotify. They were creating a completely new product from scratch and wanted help.<br><br>

                My responsibilities were to create this product by researching user needs and requirements,
                producing user flows and design the final product. I also conducted usability tests with users to
                gather feedback to calidate ideas and communicated the results to stakeholders.

                I was responsible to drive this project forward and held workshops, produced requirements, concepts and
                wireframes. To test the PoC I invited users to try it out and validate the idea. The results were
                communicated to stakeholders at the company.
